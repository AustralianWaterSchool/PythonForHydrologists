A notebook is subdivided into cells, which either have text or code. The code cells can easily be recognized as they are preceded by `In [ ]:` or `In [n]:` where `n` is a counter. To edit the code, select the cell by positioning your cursor in one of the code cells either by clicking the left mouse button or by navigating using the up and down arrow keys. Executing the code cell can be doen by clicking the Run button in the top menu of the notebook or, much easier, by holding the [shift] key and hitting [enter]. The output, preceded by `Out [n]:` (where n is a number), then appears below the code cell."
